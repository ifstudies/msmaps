# Marriage and Intact Family Visualizations

These maps and tables show (1) the percentage of adults aged 35-64 who are married and (2) the percentage of children in married-couple households.

These analyses are based on ACS5 2023 data and outlines from the US Census Bureau. Only regions with at least 100 adults aged 35-64 (for marriage share maps) and 100 children (for intact family maps) are included; percentiles and ranks are based off of these filtered sets of regions.
